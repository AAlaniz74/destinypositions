As a content creator, I am often misrepresented. Sometimes, this is by people who disagree with me and want to attack a [straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man). But at the same time, part of the problem is that in order to find out what I believe, you might have to sit through an hour long YouTube video in which I get into the nitty-gritty details of an issue. Not ideal.

This problem has only gotten worse over time. I have been streaming for over 10 years, and I feel like a good chunk of people out there may have unfavorable positions of me based on positions that I don't actually hold. And in a lot of my conversations, it is exhausting to have to constantly clarify that the things that other people have said about me are not true.

Let's fix that - my actual positions are laid out on this website. If you see someone online misrepresenting (e.g. "Destiny believes in X"), feel free to link them to the specific subsection of this website that clarifies my real position.
