## Omni-Liberalism

In politics, it can be useful to know which particular ideology someone subscribes to. However, I do not fall perfectly in-line with any particular ideology. I describe myself as an *Omni-Liberal*, which is a made-up, tongue-in-cheek term to encapsulate the general position of:

1. Having the core values of liberalism (e.g. freedom and equality).
2. Taking the best parts of all different kinds of political ideologies and using them together in a pragmatic way.

## Philosophical Axioms and Consistency

I think that political positions should be the result of a consistent system - namely, an underlying philosophical or moral framework. My personal system starts with the axiom of wanting to maximize my own internal happiness. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-eTcjGsK08) provides a full explanation.

My political positions generally follow from my moral system. I think that this is much better state of affairs than having my positional positions be inherited from my parents, or inherited from a particular political party.

A lot of political debate actually just boils down to having a different moral system. Instead of two people arguing at a surface level about an issue, it is sometimes more useful to dive down and try to figure out what the other person actually believes at a fundamental level. This is why hypotheticals are an extremely useful tool - it can help pinpoint exactly where you disagree with someone else.

## Libertarianism

[Libertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism) is concerned with maximizing liberty and personal freedom. I viewed myself as a libertarian when I was a teenager and have read books by [Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand).

I am still pro liberty and pro freedom, but my political views have evolved. Libertarianism does not seem to do a very good job at solving some major problems, like social inequality and global warming. The latter, in particular, seems likely only to be solved by international cooperation at a global level.

## The Alt-Right

I do not support the alt-right, but I will acknowledge that there is a real problem with many Americans feeling like they have been left-behind.

My most recent [debate with Erik Striker & James Allsup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48MhURMh1A) is emblematic of most discourse that I have had with alt-right figures. When confronted with challenges to their ideas, many retreat to anecdotes. Most concerningly, they have no real policy positions and no plan to actually affect political change.

## Populism

I do not support [populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism).

Populism is usually defined as the "people" versus "the elites". This happens on both the right (e.g. the alt-right & Donald Trump) and the left (e.g. Bernie-or-Busters). Populism is powerful because it feeds off negative emotions, but is often not based in facts.

## Capitalism

I would consider myself to be a capitalist, with some caveats.

At a high-level, capitalism is best-known societal mechanism to generate wealth and make everyone better off. This is completely non-controversial and is what most actual economists and political scientists believe, and has been demonstrated over and over throughout history.

However, there are different kinds of capitalism, ranging from *[laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire)* (e.g. free market) to [state capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism) (e.g. China). We know that completely free-market systems have serious downsides, such as monopolies and not properly accounting for externalities (e.g. pollution, global warming). Thus, I believe that capitalism should be tempered by a strong government that tries to correct for these problems. (Not surprisingly, this is the exact state of affairs in nearly all advanced economies in the world.)

## Socialism / Communism

### The Academic Arguments

In order to learn more about socialism, I have had discussions with many people who self-identify as [socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism), including [Michael Albert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Albert) (an economist, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7tfIxcQYPU)), [Ben Burgis](https://twitter.com/BenBurgis) (Jacobin columnist, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaKBp9x3CpE&t=163s)), and more. (Search YouTube for "destiny socialism").

When we actually get into the nitty-gritty of how socialism would work on a day to day basis, there are things that socialists cannot explain or have murky explanations for, such as how new capital is allocated, and how workers can change their positions.

My deep-dive into socialism has resulted in a high amount of skepticism with many of its claims.

### Online Socialist Activism

A lot of the discourse around socialism (e.g. on Twitch, YouTube, and Twitter) are from people who are widely ignorant of economics and how capital markets actually work. Plenty of socialist-leaning content creators have a fundamental misunderstanding of basic facts, such as [Philosophy Tube's video on housing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbhZWZf0gM).

While there are plenty of highly intelligent people who identify as a socialist, my general interactions with "online socialists" or "online lefties" from 2018 to 2020 have left me with a very low impression of the community at large.

### Co-ops

Co-ops, or [cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative), are business owned by the workers. Many advocates of socialism argue that co-ops have many benefits, and co-ops would certainly be a primary part of most forms of socialism.

I don't see anything inherently wrong with co-ops. I agree that they could, theoretically, be a superior way of organizing a business. If you want to experiment with making a co-op, you should do so.

With that said, if co-ops were really a vehicle for increased happiness, productivity, quality, or efficiency, then it seems likely that they would already have caught on and would already be widespread throughout society.

### Political Ineffectiveness

A major gripe that I have with "online socialism" is that it is politically impotent.

All policies instituted by the government are going to have pros and cons. Let's debate these policies and try to find out which one will be the best. Once we know that, we can then put pressure on our local politicians and state representatives to try and implement them.

But most socialists that I talk to have no actual policy positions. They live in a fantasy land where all capital is abolished, without a plan for how to get there and without a plan for solving the actual problems that we are facing right now.

## Social Justice

I think that social justice is a real thing.

However, sometimes social justice can go too far (e.g. Twitch banning the "blind playthrough" tag, completely made up pronouns based on animals).

On the other hand, a lot of people against social justice have ridiculous and overblown concepts of what social justice even is (from e.g. watching "SJW owns" videos on YouTube).

The right place is somewhere in the middle - try to have respect for other people, especially if it won't inconvienence you that much. In general, this means that if someone wants you to call them she/her, then you should be polite and do so.

## Voting

Voting is important.

People in America (and around the world) have problems <strong>right now</strong> that need to be solved. And that's best done by working within the current system, building coalitions with like-minded people, and voting for the best candidate (at both a local and a national level).

## Violence

In general, I am against violence. However, I think it is probably okay to be physically violent in response to some forms of political violence (e.g. wrongful deportation).

## Protesting & Rioting

I am for non-violent protesting. Protesting is a legitimate form of political activism and has a long history of being a "very-American" thing to do (e.g. the original [Boston Tea Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party)).

Additionally, I am for violent protesting (e.g. rioting), but only if the destruction of property is public (e.g. a government building like a courthouse).

I am not for rioting when the destruction of property is private (e.g. a local business).

## Kyle Rittenhouse & Defense of Property

First, see my position on [protesting & rioting](#protesting--rioting).

In general, I do not support vigilantism. I think Kyle Rittenhouse was clearly misguided in his attempts to cross state borders and should have stayed home.

Putting aside whether Kyle Rittenhouse was "in the right" or "in the wrong", I think that we can have a separate discussion on defending property. I think that, in general, people have a right to defend their property. 

For example, if someone wants to destroy your local business, then you have a right to defend your local business. It does not really make a difference whether or not the people who want to destroy your business are pro-black, pro-nazi, or pro-Jesus Christ.

Furthermore, I think that people have a right to defend their property with lethal force, but only if the attacker has been given notice. In other words, if Alice says "I will shoot you if you try to burn down my business", and Bob hears this, and tries to burn down the business anyway, Alice should be in the moral clear to fatally shoot them.

(I dutifully acknowledge that there can be degrees of escalation and de-escalation; the above example is simplified to get the point across.)

Many disagreements over whether or not defense of personal property is justified boil down to a difference of underlying values. Middle-class and well-off people may underestimate the personal sacrifice and the years of time invested into obtaining a business, a car, or even something as simple as a stereo system.
