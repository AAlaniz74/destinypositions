## Ex-Wife & Son

I have a son called Nathan with my ex-wife. They live in Omaha, Nebraska. My ex-wife was physically abusive to me when we were together, which was one of the main reasons for the divorce. However, we are now on good terms and raise our son together.

I chose to move to California for work-related reasons - the opportunities for collaboration were much higher. The move has allowed me to grow my platform. I love my son and spend as much time with him as possible, making several trips per year back to Omaha to visit him.

## Melina

[Melina](https://www.twitch.tv/melina) is my fianc√©e. We met in New Zealand when she was 20 years old and I was 30 years old. We are in an open relationship. More specifically, this means that we treat each other as primary partners, but each of us are free to pursue secondary relationships (with the blessing of the other). I am aware that throughout the world, polyamorous relationships and open relationships are not common. Please understand that my having an open relationship does not mean that I love my partner any less than if I was in a monogomous relationship.

## College

I went to the [University of Nebraska at Omaha](https://www.unomaha.edu/) and majored in music, but dropped out.

In general, I do not think that people need to have a college degree in order to have good opinions or to know what they are talking about.

However, a formal education doesn't hurt. I think that laymen should generally defer to the consensus of experts, as they can misinterpret the data. A good example of this can be found in [my discussion with Vegan Gains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yK-lO98scI).
